### Task 3 - Expectation Management & Cross-Functional Collaboration
# Context:
You have two tasks above (Task 1 & Task 2). Take tomorrow’s date as the original due date for
both tasks. There is a family emergency at your place due to which you won’t be able to meet
the due date of the above tasks for at least 3 more days. Task 1 is for a low-priority customer
who has not provided any go-live date to us. Task 2 is for a priority customer whose campaign
needs to go live in the next 2 days.
Note - You can only ask for an extension for 1 task from the above.


-----
**Task:1 What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to
this.**

Two Scenario come to my mind: 
First and foremost just beacuse i have been given freedom to extend one of the task, will choose task 2 for extension.

if i am working in a team 

> In these kind of special scenario i belive team mates can come to rescue. Since Task 2 is for priority customer, i will try to offload and distribute the pressure with my other teammates. See if they can do the boilerplate stuff of the work on my behalf and submit. If Project is huge, i will rather ask for an extension, then giving barebones of a project.
My team will then take care of task1, and in some time i will try to return the favour by not taking scheduled leaves.

if i am not working in a team

> i will ask for an extension for task 2 and will try to complete both the projects by not taking my scheduled Leaves afterwards.


-----
**Task:2 How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.**

**Task:3 How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
email to the customer informing them about this).**

i am considering the worst case, By not meeting the deadline for task1 and asking extension for task2.

Task 1:
>Subject: Update on Task Completion

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a delay in the completion of Task 2.
Unfortunately, I have encountered an unexpected Emergency which requires my immediate attention. As a result, I will not be able to meet the original deadline for the task.

I understand the inconvenience this might cause.
I have re-prioritized my workload and I am doing everything in my power to minimize the impact on our project timeline.

For the time being, i will not be availbale for 3 days hence will not be able to meed up with the deadline. I would appreciate your understanding in this matter and i assure u this task will be at priority for me once things get resolved at my end.

Thank you for your patience and support. I look forward to resolving this task and delivering the completed task to you as soon as possible.
